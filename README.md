# How does distance calculated?

## Direct Echo
Direct echo mean when signal reflects back at 90 angle. The distance for direct echo can be calculated with the following formula:
```
Distance L = 1/2 × T × C
```
where L is the distance, T is the time between the emission and reception, and C is the sonic speed. (The value is multiplied by 1/2 because T is the time for go-and-return distance.) <br>
